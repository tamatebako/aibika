= Aibika: Ruby applications in a single executable on Windows

== Purpose

Aibika packages a Ruby application into a single executable for the Windows
platform.

The resulting executable is self-extracting and self-running, containing:

* the Ruby interpreter;
* packaged Ruby source code; and
* any additionally needed Ruby libraries or DLLs.

NOTE: Aibika was created from the Metanorma-enhanced fork of the
https://github.com/larsch/ocra[One-click Ruby Application "Ocra" packager].
The first Aibika version was launched as 1.3.12. The last version of Ocra
was 1.3.11 from 2020.

NOTE: Aibika is considered a temporary solution to the full-fledged
functionality of https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako[Tebako], which provides a
user-space mounted-disk experience with minimal intervention.


== Supported platforms

Aibika only supports Windows.


== Supported Ruby versions

The Aibika packager supports the following versions of Ruby for packaging:

* 2.7.7
* 3.0.6
* 3.1.4
* 3.2.2


== Features

* LZMA Compression (optional, default on)
* Both windowed/console mode supported
* Includes gems based on usage, or from a Bundler Gemfile


== Installation

[source,sh]
----
gem install aibika
----

// Stand-alone version: Get abika.rb from
// https://github.com/tamatebako/aibika/releases/
// Requires nothing but a working Ruby and MinGW installations on Windows

== Migration from Ocra

Aibika 1.3.12 is fully compatible with Ocra 1.13.11
In order to migrate your build scripts replace ocra invokations with aibika.

=== Compilation

* Aibika will load your script (using `Kernel#load`) and build
  the executable when it exits.

* Your program should 'require' all necessary files when invoked without
  arguments, so Aibika can detect all dependencies.

* DLLs are detected automatically but only those located in your Ruby
  installation are included.

* .rb files will become console applications. .rbw files will become
  windowed application (without a console window popping
  up). Alternatively, use the `--console` or
  `--windows` options.

=== Running your application

* The 'current working directory' is not changed by Aibika when running
  your application. You must change to the installation or temporary
  directory yourself. See also below.
* When the application is running, the `AIBIKA_EXECUTABLE` environment
  variable points to the .exe (with full path).
* The temporary location of the script can be obtained by inspected
  the `$0` variable.
* Aibika does not set up the include path. Use `$:.unshift File.dirname($0)`
  at the start of your script if you need to `require` additional source files
  from the same directory as your main script.

=== Pitfalls

* Avoid modifying load paths at run time. Specify load paths using -I
  or `RUBYLIB` if you must, but don't expect Aibika to preserve them for
  runtime. Aibika may pack sources into other directories than you
  expect.
* If you use `.rbw` files or the `--windows` option, then check
  that your application works with `rubyw.exe` before trying with Aibika.
* Avoid absolute paths in your code and when invoking Aibika.

== Requirements

* Windows
* Working Ruby installation
* MinGW Installation

== Technical details

Aibika first runs the target script in order to detect any files that
are loaded and used at runtime (Using `Kernel#require` and
`Kernel#load`).

Aibika embeds everything needed to run a Ruby script into a single
executable file. The file contains the .exe stub which is compiled
from C-code, and a custom opcode format containing instructions to
create directories, save files, set environment variables and run
programs. The Aibika script generates this executable and the
instructions to be run when it is launched.

When executed, the Aibika stub extracts the Ruby interpreter and your
scripts into a temporary directory. The directory will contains the
same directory layout as your Ruby installation. The source files for
your application will be put in the 'src' subdirectory.

=== Libraries

Any code that is loaded through `Kernel#require` when your
script is executed will be included in the Aibika
executable. Conditionally loaded code will not be loaded and included
in the executable unless the code is actually run when Aibika invokes
your script. Otherwise, Aibika won't know about it and will not include
the source files.

RubyGems are handled specially. Whenever a file from a Gem is
detected, Aibika will attempt to include all the required files from
that specific Gem, expect some unlikely needed files such as readme's
and other documentation. This behaviour can be controlled by using the
`--gem-*` options. Behaviour can be changed for all gems or specific
gems using `--gem-*=gemname`.

Libraries found in non-standard path (for example, if you invoke Aibika
with `ruby -I some/path`) will be placed into the site `dir`
(`lib/ruby/site_ruby`). Avoid changing `$LOAD_PATH` or
`$:` from your script to include paths outside your source
tree, since Aibika may place the files elsewhere when extracted into the
temporary directory.

In case your script (or any of its dependencies) sets up autoloaded
module using `Kernel#autoload`, Aibika will automatically try to
load them to ensure that they are all included in the
executable. Modules that doesn't exist will be ignored (a warning will
be logged).

Dynamic link libraries (`.dll` files, for example `WxWidgets`, or other
source files) will be detected and included by Aibika.

=== Including libraries non-automatically

If an application or framework is complicated enough that it tends
to confuse Aibika's automatic dependency resolution, then you can
use other means to specify what needs to be packaged with your app.

To disable automatic dependency resolution, use the `--no-dep-run`
option; with it, Aibika will skip executing your program during the
build process. This on the other hand requires using `--gem-full` option
(see more below); otherwise Aibika will not include all the necessary
files for the gems.

You will also probably need to use the `--add-all-core` option to
include the Ruby core libraries.

If your app uses gems, then you can specify them in a
Bundler Gemfile, then use the --gemfile
option to supply it to Aibika. Aibika will automatically include all
gems specified, and all their dependencies.

NOTE: This assumes that the gems are installed in your system,
*not* locally packaged inside the app directory by "bundle package".

These options are particularly useful for packaging Rails
applications.  For example, to package a Rails 3 app in the
directory "someapp" and create an exe named "someapp.exe", without
actually running the app during the build, you could use the
following command:

[source,sh]
----
$ aibika someapp/script/rails someapp --output someapp.exe --add-all-core \
    --gemfile someapp/Gemfile --no-dep-run --gem-full --chdir-first -- server
----

Note the space between `--` and `server`! It's important; `server` is
an argument to be passed to rails when the script is ran.

Rails 2 apps can be packaged similarly, though you will have to
integrate them with Bundler first.

=== Gem handling

By default, Aibika includes all scripts that are loaded by your script
when it is run before packaging. Aibika detects which gems are using and
includes any additional non-script files from those gems, except
trivial files such as C/C++ source code, object files, READMEs, unit
tests, specs, etc.

This behaviour can be changed by using the --gem-* options. There are
four possible modes:

* *minimal*: Include only loaded scripts
* *guess*: Include loaded scripts and important files (DEFAULT)
* *all*: Include all scripts and important files
* *full*: Include all files

If you find that files are missing from the resulting executable, try
first with `--gem-all=gemname` for the gem that is missing, and if that
does not work, try `--gem-full=gemname`. The paranoid can use `--gem-full`
to include all files for all required gems.

=== Creating an installer for your application

To make your application start up quicker, or to allow it to
keep files in its application directory between runs, or if
you just want to make your program seem more like a "regular"
Windows application, you can have Aibika generate an installer
for your app with the free Inno Setup software.

You will first have to download and install Inno Setup 5 or
later, and also add its directory to your `PATH` (so that Aibika
can find the ISCC compiler program). Once you've done that,
you can use the `--innosetup` option to Aibika to supply an
Inno Setup script. Do not add any `[Files]` or `[Dirs]` sections
to the script; Aibika will figure those out itself.

To continue the Rails example above, let's package the Rails 3
app into an installer. Save the following as `someapp.iss`:

[source,toml]
----
[Setup]
AppName=SomeApp
AppVersion=0.1
DefaultDirName={pf}\SomeApp
DefaultGroupName=SomeApp
OutputBaseFilename=SomeAppInstaller

[Icons]
Name: "{group}\SomeApp"; Filename: "{app}\someapp.exe"
Name: "{group}\Uninstall SomeApp"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"
----

Then run this command:

[source,sh]
----
$ aibika someapp/script/rails someapp --output someapp.exe --add-all-core \
    --gemfile someapp/Gemfile --no-dep-run --gem-full --chdir-first --no-lzma \
    --innosetup someapp.iss -- server
----

If all goes well, a file named "SomeAppInstaller.exe" will be placed
into the Output directory.

=== Environment variables

Aibika executables clear the `RUBYLIB` environment variable before your
script is launched. This is done to ensure that your script does not
use load paths from the end user's Ruby installation.

Aibika executables set the `RUBYOPT` environment variable to the value it
had when you invoked Aibika. For example, if you had `"RUBYOPT=rubygems"`
on your build PC, Aibika ensures that it is also set on PC's running the
executables.

Aibika executables set `OCRA_EXECUTABLE` to the full path of the
executable, for example:

[source,rb]
----
ENV["AIBIKA_EXECUTABLE"] # => C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe
----

=== Working directory

The Aibika executable does not change the working directory when it is
launched, unless you use the `--chdir-first` option.

You should not assume that the current working directory when invoking
an executable built with .exe is the location of the source script. It
can be the directory where the executable is placed (when invoked
through the Windows Explorer), the users' current working directory
(when invoking from the Command Prompt), or even
`C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32` when the executable is invoked through
a file association.

With the `--chdir-first` option, the working directory will
always be the common parent directory of your source files. This
should be fine for most applications. However, if your application
is designed to run from the command line and take filenames as
arguments, then you cannot use this option.

If you wish to maintain the user's working directory, but need to
`require` additional Ruby scripts from the source directory, you can
add the following line to your script:

[source,rb]
----
$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.dirname($0)
----

=== Load path mangling

Adding paths to `$LOAD_PATH` or `$:` at runtime is not
recommended. Adding relative load paths depends on the working
directory being the same as where the script is located (See
above). If you have additional library files in directories below the
directory containing your source script you can use this idiom:

[source,rb]
----
$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.join(File.dirname($0), 'path/to/script')
----

=== Detecting

You can detect whether Aibika is currently building your script by
looking for the 'Aibika' constant. If it is defined, Aibika is currently
building the executable from your script. For example, you can use
this to avoid opening a GUI window when compiling executables:

[source,rb]
----
app = MyApp.new
app.main_loop unless defined?(Aibika)
----

=== Additional files and resources

You can add additional files to the Aibika executable (for example
images) by appending them to the command line. They should be placed
in the source directory with your main script (or a subdirectory).

[source,sh]
----
$ aibika mainscript.rb someimage.jpeg docs/document.txt
----

This will create the following layout in the temporary directory when
your program is executed:

----
src/mainscript.rb
src/someimage.jpeg
src/docs/document.txt
----

Both files, directories and glob patterns can be specified on the
command line. Files will be added as-is. If a directory is specified,
Aibika will include all files found below that directory.

Glob patterns (See `Dir.glob`) can be used to specify a specific set of files,
for example:

[source,sh]
----
$ aibika script.rb assets/**/*.png
----

=== Command Line Arguments

To pass command line argument to your script (both while building and
when run from the resulting executable), specify them after a
`--` marker. For example:

[source,sh]
----
$ aibika script.rb -- --some-options=value
----

This will pass `--some-options=value` to the script when
build and when running the executable. Any extra argument specified by
the user when invoking the executable will be appended after the
compile-time arguments.

=== Window/Console

By default, Aibika builds console application from `.rb` files and
windowed applications (without console window) from `.rbw` files.

Ruby on Windows provides two executables: `ruby.exe` is a console mode
application and `rubyw.exe` is a windowed application which does not
bring up a console window when launched using the Windows Explorer.
By default, or if the `--console` option is used, Aibika will
use the console runtime (`ruby.exe`). Aibika will automatically select the
windowed runtime when your script has the ".rbw" extension, or if you
specify the `--windows` command line option.

If your application works in console mode but not in windowed mode,
first check if your script works without Aibika using `rubyw.exe`. A
script that prints to standard output (using puts, print etc.) will
eventually cause an exception when run with `rubyw.exe` (when the IO
buffers run full).

You can also try wrapping your script in an exception handler that
logs any errors to a file:

[source,ruby]
----
begin
  # your script here
rescue Exception => e
  File.open("except.log") do |f|
    f.puts e.inspect
    f.puts e.backtrace
  end
end
----

== Trivia: origin of name

Aibika started as a fork of the
https://github.com/larsch/ocra[One-click Ruby Application "Ocra" packager].
"Ocra" happens to be a wordplay on "okra", the plant name, so the name
of the _flower okra_ plant, "aibika" was adopted.

The _flower okra_ is named as it blooms flowers similar to the okra, and refers to the
_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelmoschus_manihot[Abelmoschus manihot]_ plant.
_Aibika_ refers to the Spanish name of the flower okra.

Aibika, called トロロアオイ (黄蜀葵, tororoaoi), is a key ingredient to the
creation of Washi (和紙, Japanese paper).

Japanese paper is thin, durable and long-lasting because of its use of aibika.
In the manufacturing of Japanese paper, mucus extracted from the root of aibika
is used to uniformize the spread of fibers. Without this mucus in the
solution, fibers will quickly get excluded from the solution, resulting in
fibers not scattered evenly.
